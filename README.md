This repository contains the backend code for a simple note-taking application. It is implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with communication between the backend and frontend through HTTP requests and JSON data.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data storage
- Implements RESTful API endpoints for note operations

## Setup
